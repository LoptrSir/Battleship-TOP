classes Ship, Gameboard, Player built.
initializeGame() manages creation of each player and both boards, putting it in a function allows Jest to function. myFooter() moved to domManipulation.js keeps jest happy.
Built Tests: 
mocking myFooter() prevents error
Ship-   testing each constructor (true) passes.
        built basic tests for each function that passes or fails based on basic return.  Need to build functions logic.
Gameboard- testing each constructor (true) passes. (piecesGrid, attackGrid, playerSunkShipCount, OpponentSunkShipCount)
        functions have basic tests build. need to build logic.
Player- Constructor testing passes. (names,ships,score)
