TOP Battleship project
The intent is to work on testing using Jest.

10/2 makeAttack() built, need to vette calls are valid and build tests.
makeAttack test to validate out of range cell functions.
9/26 : built several more Gameboard tests. Merged multiple similar tests into a single test with multiple expects. got Ship this.orientation and setOrientation() working. created this.shipsList to verify a piece has not been placed.  Will likely remove this.ships as it seems redundant to this.board for the purpose of tracking where ships are. created index.js as webpage initializer.
9/25 1301: built multiple functioning tests for Ship and Gameboard.  placeShip() is now built too.
9/24 1332: restarting code. It started to experience function bloat.  working on more streamlined approach.
copiedXXX.ts are files from another project I'm using for better understanding my process.
rebuild ships.js, gameBoard.js, and the relevant tests.
9/10/24 1109 
classes Ship, Gameboard, Player built.
initializeGame() manages creation of each player and both boards, putting it in a function allows Jest to function. myFooter() moved to domManipulation.js keeps jest happy.
Built Tests: 
mocking myFooter() prevents error
Ship-   testing each constructor (true) passes.
        built basic tests for each function that passes or fails based on basic return.  Need to build functions logic.
Gameboard- testing each constructor (true) passes. (piecesGrid, attackGrid, playerSunkShipCount, OpponentSunkShipCount)
        functions have basic tests build. need to build logic.
Player- Constructor testing passes. (names,ships,score)
